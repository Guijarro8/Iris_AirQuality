## Project Description
This repository contains two Machine Learning projects:

1. **Iris Classification**: Uses various classification algorithms to predict the species of Iris flowers based on the characteristics from the Iris dataset.
2. **Air Quality Regression**: Implements regression models to predict air quality values based on variables like temperature, pressure, wind speed, etc.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- numpy 1.20.3
- pandas 1.2.5
- pandas-profiling 3.0.0
- scikit-learn 0.24.2
- tqdm 4.56.0


## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Guijarro8/Iris_AirQuality.git

## Repository is organized as follows:

- "/Notebooks..."_: with all the information of the steps and decisions taken.
- "/models/": The models used in the project, calibrated and saved. 
- "/reports/": Descriptive analytical reports on the data.
- "/results/": Data dictionaries with the different evaluation metrics of the models.
- "/utils/": Python code used for each model organized in folders according to whether it is of common use or not. In "common.py" 
are the functions used in the two models and the specific functions are organized by modules.
